# Introduction to AI Agents

## The Dawn of the Agent Era

We are witnessing the birth of a new computing paradigm. Just as the internet connected computers and mobile connected people, AI agents are connecting intelligence itself.

## What Are AI Agents?

An AI agent is an autonomous software entity that can:
- Perceive its environment through sensors or APIs
- Make decisions based on observations
- Take actions to achieve specific goals
- Learn and adapt from experiences

```{code-block} python
:caption: Simple conceptual agent

class AIAgent:
    def perceive(self, environment):
        """Gather information from the environment"""
        return environment.get_state()
    
    def decide(self, perception):
        """Make decisions based on perceptions"""
        return self.model.predict(perception)
    
    def act(self, decision):
        """Execute actions in the environment"""
        return self.environment.execute(decision)
    
    def learn(self, outcome):
        """Update internal model based on outcomes"""
        self.model.update(outcome)
```

## Types of AI Agents

### By Autonomy Level

1. **Reactive Agents**: Respond to immediate inputs
2. **Deliberative Agents**: Plan before acting
3. **Learning Agents**: Improve through experience
4. **Collaborative Agents**: Work with other agents

### By Application Domain

- **Task Automation Agents**: Execute repetitive tasks
- **Decision Support Agents**: Assist human decision-making
- **Creative Agents**: Generate content, code, designs
- **Analytical Agents**: Process and interpret data

## The Agent Revolution

### Why Now?

Three technological advances have converged:

1. **Language Models**: GPT-4, Claude, Gemini provide reasoning capabilities
2. **Protocols**: MCP and A2A enable standardized communication
3. **Infrastructure**: Cloud platforms support agent deployment

### The Promise

AI agents promise to:
- Automate complex workflows
- Enable new forms of human-AI collaboration
- Create emergent intelligence through agent networks
- Democratize access to AI capabilities
